# LIRI node app

## Overview

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will take in the information you put in and gives you back data.

LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.
